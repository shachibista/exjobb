Code for my bachelor's thesis on mobile application framework for diagnosis of skin cancer.

This repository will be updated with more information on code structure.

## Abstract

Skin cancer is the one most common forms of cancer among fair-skinned individuals.
It occurs on various depths of the skin, and exists in three forms Squamous Cell Car-
cinoma (SCC), Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Malignant Melanoma (MM). While
the first two are relatively harmless, Melanoma is a deadly form of cancer where the
cells producing protective melanin mutate and metastasize quickly to surrounding tis-
sue. Early diagnosis is essential for successful treatment. It is, however difficult for
non-experts to diagnose and referrals to expert dermatologists are puncutated by long
waiting times due to the relative shortage of expert dermatologists. Due to the highly
visible nature of melanoma, computer vision and image processing techniques can be
used to produce a preliminary diagnosis. This paper lays foundational work on a mobile
application framework for automated diagnosis of skin cancer. We develop a prototype
mobile application, develop strategies for integration of the application and support
systems and explore algorithms for preprocessing and extraction of lesions from der-
moscopic images.
